# PadelApp
This project is being developed and used as a lab apply the tools I have been learning during the courses that I am doing.

The goal is to have an application to setup an manage padel games. 
Once logged in, the user will be able to create a game, see wich are the games are available, enroll to play, etc. 
When the numbers of players is complete the game owner will be able, among other things, to change the status of the game to confirmed, as well as publish the score after the game is over.
